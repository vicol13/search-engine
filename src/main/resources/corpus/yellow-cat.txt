Many problems in software development are not because of code but developers creating the wrong software.
This isnâ€™t unusual because software is emergent and most people only understand what they want after what they asked for is created and they realise it's not that.
Developers can help the process by being more inquisitive about the requirements and passing the yellow cat test.
We need to see what is there, not what people are telling the development team or how developers assume the software should work. Initial requirements cover 50/70 percent and will always change.
Assumption are bugs created by developers by assuming they know how the software should work. Developers need to open their eyes to assumptions and clarify them as soon as possible.
If a development team builds on assumptions, when the assumption is wrong, the code and anything else (code, devops, documentation, tests) will need to be changed.
