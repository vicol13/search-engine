Many problems in software development are not because of code but developers creating the wrong software.
This isnâ€™t unusual because software is emergent and most people only understand what they want after what they asked for is created and they realise it's not that.
Developers can help the process by being more inquisitive about the requirements and passing the yellow cat test.
