I like this idea I’m not sure how well I live up to it.
It’s certainly true that as I’ve gotten older, and done lots more reading — including a ton specifically for my work as a journalist— I’ve become far less sure of my conclusions, and more aware of how many subjects I know absolutely nothing about.
The other part of an antilibrary, though, is that it makes you constantly aware that you could explore more things. By having all those books lying around unread, they trigger curiosity. Every time I walk from my bedroom desk to my bathroom I pass dozens of books I’ve never read — their colorful spines a little visual peripheral reminder that hey, I could pick them up and start reading.
And sometimes I do!
Particularly if I’m procrastinating on a piece of writing, grabbing an unread book and leafing through a few pages feels like a noble way to avoid doing my actual work, lol.
Having unread books lying around is also a useful counterweight to the constant pull of online media.
When I’ve got free time, I am pretty lazy; I’m liable to start dorking around online, because my phone is always there.
But if the books are also lying around, in my visual field?
Then they have a fighting chance at also capturing my hummingbird attention.
If I literally need to move an unread book aside so I can make room at my kitchen table for a lunch sandwich, it hugely increases the chance I’ll open it and at least glance at a few pages.
(As an aside, I think this is why most of my pleasure reading is poetry and nonfiction, with very few novels.
Poetry and nonfiction are much easier to dip in and out of. A single poem is an (often) short little nugget of literature; nonfiction books usually have bits of data or anecdotes and stories that stand on their own, and can be absorbed a page or paragraph at a time.
A novel, in contrast, requires me to maintain a train of thought — a narrative, and cast of characters — and is, for me, less glanceable.)
